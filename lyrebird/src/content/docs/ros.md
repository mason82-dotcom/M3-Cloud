description: The lyrebird_controller node follows PX4's uXRCE-DDS topic convention -- fmu/in/... commands, fmu/out/... telemetry -- so PX4 ROS 2 experience carries straight over to Lyrebird's DJI-backed ground station.

---

Full ROS 2 Humble package. `lyrebird_controller` follows PX4's real uXRCE-DDS topic convention as
closely as DJI's telemetry/command surface allows: telemetry is grouped into typed messages under
`fmu/out/...`, and discrete actions are dispatched through one `fmu/in/vehicle_command` topic keyed
by a MAV_CMD-style command id -- the same shape as PX4's real `VehicleCommand`/MAVLink
`COMMAND_LONG`. A developer who already knows PX4's ROS 2 API should recognize the topic layout,
the command vocabulary, and most message field names immediately.

Every command id and message field below was checked against MAVLink's `common.xml` and
PX4-Autopilot's real `msg/versioned/*.msg` sources, not approximated from memory. Where DJI
telemetry has no PX4 equivalent to reuse (gimbal/camera status, LRF), the message is Lyrebird's own
but keeps PX4's snake_case naming style.

It checks for new telemetry at 20 Hz but publishes only when the drone has actually sent a new
snapshot, so the topic rate follows the aircraft's telemetry interval (default ~2 Hz) rather than
repeating each sample.

```

`lyrebird_controller/fleet_auto_discovery.py` also ships its own
`config/fleet_settings.yaml`, loaded by `FleetAutoDiscoveryManager` at startup -- see
[Fleet auto-scaling](#fleet-auto-scaling) below.

`lyrebird_controller/topics.py` is the single source of truth for every topic name, type, and QoS
profile -- both `controller.py` and the `ros_monitor` container's dashboard bridge import it,
instead of each maintaining its own hand-written topic list.

## Namespacing

Exactly as before: each drone gets its own ROS namespace at launch (e.g. `/mini1/`), with
`fmu/out/...` and `fmu/in/...` nested inside it -- e.g. `/mini1/fmu/out/battery_status` -- matching
PX4's own per-vehicle namespacing pattern.

## Fleet auto-scaling

`fleet_auto_discovery.launch.py` doesn't just launch whatever it finds at startup and stop
looking. It runs one `FleetAutoDiscoveryManager` node (`lyrebird_controller/fleet_auto_discovery.py`),
which rescans the network on a timer (`discovery_period_sec`, default 30s) for the life of the
launch, and spins up a namespaced `lyrebird_controller_<name>` `DjiNode` for any drone that
wasn't there yet -- no restart of the ROS 2 stack needed to pick up a drone powered on after
launch. Every `DjiNode` it creates lives inside this one process, sharing one
`MultiThreadedExecutor`, since the fleet size isn't known ahead of time and a fixed set of
`ros2 launch` `Node` actions can't be declared for it.

Because they share one process, the manager creates one shared MAVLink UDP listener for the whole
fleet. Each aircraft is registered provisionally by its discovered IP and name, then bound to its
MAVLink `sysid` when the first autopilot heartbeat arrives. `sysid` is used for wire routing; the
discovered name still determines the ROS namespace (for example `/mini1/`) and is never inferred
from a numeric system id. Duplicate active system ids are rejected, while a stale route can be
rebound when an aircraft reconnects. On connecting, each drone is also pushed the settings in
`lyrebird_controller/config/fleet_settings.yaml` -- the same settings the app's cockpit settings
menu edits, plus which transport (HTTP/MAVLink/both) to use and an optional auto-assigned
`rthAltitude` range spaced across the fleet -- so a fleet can be brought up with consistent
settings without opening the app on each aircraft.

This replaced an older mechanism (`auto_discovery_native.launch.py`, one `ros2 launch` `Node`
action per drone via a rescanning `TimerAction`) that could not assign MAVLink ports or push any
settings, since each drone got its own OS process rather than sharing one.

### `fleet_settings.yaml` reference

Point a launch file at a different copy of this file via the `fleet_settings_file` ROS
parameter to run a different profile per deployment (e.g.
`ros2 launch lyrebird_bringup fleet_auto_discovery.launch.py fleet_settings_file:=/path/to/fleet_settings.yaml`).
Any key below can also be set the normal ROS way (a launch file's own `parameters=[...]`, or
`--ros-args -p`), which always wins over the file. Comment out a key to leave that setting alone
on the drone instead of overwriting it.

Top-level (ground-station-side, not pushed to the drone):

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `transport` | `both` | Which wire every discovered drone is commanded over: `http` \| `mavlink` \| `both`. Independent of everything below -- this is how the ground station talks to the aircraft, not an app setting. Keep it `both` (MAVLink carries what it can, HTTP fills the rest) unless you have a specific reason to run one wire only. |
| `discovery_period_sec` | `30.0` | Seconds between rescans for newly joined drones. |
| `discovery_timeout_sec` | `5.0` | How long each scan waits for answers. |
| `mavlink_port` | `14551` | One shared MAVLink listen port for the whole Lyrebird fleet. The bundled value leaves QGroundControl's usual `14550` available on the same host. `mavlink_port_base` remains a backwards-compatible alias. Otherwise comes from `LB_MAVLINK_PORT`. |
| `mavlink_peer_port` | `14550` | The common UDP port every aircraft listens on for commands. Otherwise comes from `LB_MAVLINK_PEER_PORT`. |

`fleet_settings` (pushed to every drone on connection -- the same values the app's cockpit
settings menu edits):

| Key | Default | Valid values |
|---|---|---|
| `maxFlightHeight` | `120` | Meters AGL flight ceiling. |
| `maxFlightDistance` | `500` | Meters, max distance from the home point. |
| `distanceLimitEnabled` | `true` | `true` \| `false` -- whether `maxFlightDistance` is enforced. |
| `videoSource` | `drone` | `drone` \| `phone` \| `mock` -- `mock` is the built-in Mock MP4 test pattern, useful for testing `streamingMode` end-to-end without a live feed. |
| `streamingMode` | `webrtc` | `webrtc` \| `rtmp` \| `rtsp` \| `agora` \| `gb28181` -- `webrtc` means WebRTC via WHIP push (DJI SDK naming, not a separate "whip" mode). |
| `webrtcResolution` | `auto` | `auto` \| `1080p` \| `720p` \| `480p` (only used when `streamingMode: webrtc`). |
| `webrtcFps` | `20` | `5` \| `10` \| `15` \| `20` \| `25` \| `30` (only used when `streamingMode: webrtc`). |
| `detectionsEnabled` | `false` | `true` \| `false` -- on-board object detection. |
| `detectionSource` | `none` | `none` \| `dji_onboard` \| `yolo_on_phone` (only used when `detectionsEnabled: true`). |
| `edgeConfidenceThreshold` | `0.30` | `0.10`-`0.70` in `0.05` steps -- minimum confidence for a detection to be reported. |
| `rcControlMode` | `usa` | `jp` \| `usa` \| `ch` \| `custom` -- RC stick mapping. |
| `mediamtxServer` | *(unset)* | MediaMTX relay server URL, only used by some streaming modes (an rtsp relay or gb28181 bridging). Leave unset to use the phone's own local server. |
| `surfaceH264Encoder` | `false` | `true` \| `false` -- experimental: encode WebRTC video straight from a DJI SDK surface instead of the default encoder. Takes effect on the phone's next app restart, not immediately. |

`rth_altitude_range` (optional; overrides `rthAltitude` in `fleet_settings` when present):

| Key | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `min` | RTH altitude (meters) for the first discovered drone. |
| `max` | Ceiling: no drone is assigned above this. |
| `step` | Meters added per logical drone slot, independent of MAVLink ports, capped at `max` once the fleet outgrows the range. |

`drone_settings` maps a drone's discovered name (e.g. `mini3`) to its own settings dict,
overriding `fleet_settings`/`rth_altitude_range` for that drone only -- e.g. `{"mini3":
{"rthAltitude": 60, "droneName": "Mini 3", "mavlinkSystemId": 1}}`. `droneName` and
`mavlinkSystemId` are deliberately not fleet-wide keys: the former is human identity and the
latter is a unique manual vehicle assignment. Manual IDs are `1..99`; omitted IDs use the
aircraft's serial-derived automatic range `100..254`. Both can also be changed in the app.

## Commands (`fmu/in/...`)

| Topic | Type | Body |
|-------|------|------|
| `fmu/in/vehicle_command` | `lyrebird_msgs/VehicleCommand` | `command` id + `param1..param7`, see table below |
| `fmu/in/trajectory_setpoint` | `lyrebird_msgs/TrajectorySetpoint` | `latitude, longitude, altitude, yaw, speed, yaw_mode` |
| `fmu/in/manual_control_setpoint` | `lyrebird_msgs/ManualControlSetpoint` | `roll, pitch, throttle, yaw` ∈ [-1,1] (virtual stick) |
| `fmu/in/goto_trajectory_dji_native` | `String` | `"(speed, [(lat,lon,alt),...])"` |
| `fmu/in/set_setting` | `String` | `"key=value"` (webapp setting keys) |
| `fmu/in/download_media` | `String` | on-camera file name |

### `vehicle_command` command ids

Real MAV_CMD ids (from MAVLink `common.xml` / PX4's `VehicleCommand.msg`) are reused wherever the
semantics match, so `command: 22` really is `MAV_CMD_NAV_TAKEOFF`:

| Command | id | Params |
|---|---|---|
| `VEHICLE_CMD_NAV_TAKEOFF` | 22 | — |
| `VEHICLE_CMD_NAV_LAND` | 21 | — |
| `VEHICLE_CMD_NAV_RETURN_TO_LAUNCH` | 20 | — |
| `VEHICLE_CMD_CONDITION_YAW` | 115 | param1=yaw angle (deg) |
| `VEHICLE_CMD_DO_CHANGE_ALTITUDE` | 186 | param1=altitude (m) |
| `VEHICLE_CMD_DO_GIMBAL_MANAGER_PITCHYAW` | 1000 | param1=pitch (deg), param2=yaw (deg); NaN = unset (send one axis at a time by NaN-ing the other) |
| `VEHICLE_CMD_SET_CAMERA_ZOOM` | 531 | param2=zoom ratio |
| `VEHICLE_CMD_VIDEO_START_CAPTURE` | 2500 | — |
| `VEHICLE_CMD_VIDEO_STOP_CAPTURE` | 2501 | — |
| `VEHICLE_CMD_IMAGE_START_CAPTURE` | 2000 | — |

DJI-only actions with no MAV_CMD equivalent use `VEHICLE_CMD_LYREBIRD_*` ids in MAVLink's own
documented user-command range (31000-31999), so they can never collide with a real MAV_CMD:

| Command | id | Params |
|---|---|---|
| `VEHICLE_CMD_LYREBIRD_ABORT_MISSION` | 31015 | — |
| `VEHICLE_CMD_LYREBIRD_ABORT_ALL` | 31016 | — |
| `VEHICLE_CMD_LYREBIRD_ENABLE_VIRTUAL_STICK` | 31017 | — |
| `VEHICLE_CMD_LYREBIRD_ABORT_DJI_NATIVE_MISSION` | 31018 | — |
| `VEHICLE_CMD_LYREBIRD_DEACTIVATE_MANUAL_OVERRIDE` | 31019 | — |
| `VEHICLE_CMD_LYREBIRD_GIMBAL_REL_PITCH` | 31020 | param1=degrees relative to current pitch |
| `VEHICLE_CMD_LYREBIRD_GIMBAL_REL_YAW` | 31021 | param1=degrees relative to current yaw |
| `VEHICLE_CMD_LYREBIRD_SET_RTH_ALTITUDE` | 31022 | param1=altitude (m) |
| `VEHICLE_CMD_LYREBIRD_CAPTURE_TEMPERATURE` | 31023 | — |
| `VEHICLE_CMD_LYREBIRD_LIST_MEDIA` | 31024 | — |
| `VEHICLE_CMD_LYREBIRD_LRF_MEASURE` | 31025 | — |
| `VEHICLE_CMD_LYREBIRD_DROP` | 31026 | — |

Camera, media, and LRF commands block for as long as the aircraft takes to answer (up to 120 s for
a download), so they run on a single-worker thread pool and answer asynchronously on their own
`fmu/out/camera/*` and `fmu/out/lrf_*` result topics rather than stalling the telemetry loop.

## Telemetry (`fmu/out/...`)

| Topic | Type | Replaces (old flat topics) |
|-------|------|------|
| `fmu/out/vehicle_command_ack` | `VehicleCommandAck` | `command_ack/waypoint_seq`, `command_ack/yaw_seq`, `command_ack/altitude_seq` |
| `fmu/out/vehicle_global_position` | `VehicleGlobalPosition` | `location`, `satellite_count` |
| `fmu/out/home_position` | `HomePosition` | `home_location`, `home_set` |
| `fmu/out/vehicle_local_position` | `VehicleLocalPosition` | `speed`, `speed_vector`, `heading`, `altitude`, `attitude` |
| `fmu/out/battery_status` | `BatteryStatus` | `battery_level`, `distance_to_home`, `remaining_flight_time`, `time_needed_to_go_home`, `time_needed_to_land`, `time_to_landing_spot`, `max_radius_can_fly_and_go_home`, `battery_needed_to_go_home`, `battery_needed_to_land` |
| `fmu/out/vehicle_status` | `VehicleStatus` | `flight_mode`, `manual_override_active`, `ready_to_takeoff`, `takeoff_block_reason` |
| `fmu/out/mission_result` | `MissionResult` | `waypoint_reached`, `intermediary_waypoint_reached`, `altitude_reached`, `yaw_reached`, `waypoint_seq`, `altitude_seq`, `yaw_seq` |
| `fmu/out/gimbal_status` | `GimbalStatus` | `gimbal_attitude`, `gimbal_joint_attitude`, `gimbal_yaw`, `gimbal_pitch` |
| `fmu/out/camera_status` | `CameraStatus` | `zoom_fl`, `hybrid_fl`, `optical_fl`, `zoom_ratio`, `camera/is_recording`, `camera/thermal_max_temp` |
| `fmu/out/camera/capture_result` | `String` | `camera/capture_result` (unchanged payload) |
| `fmu/out/camera/media_list` | `String` | `camera/media_list` (unchanged payload) |
| `fmu/out/camera/download_result` | `String` | `camera/download_result` (unchanged payload) |
| `fmu/out/lrf_target` | `NavSatFix` | `lrf/target` (unchanged type) |
| `fmu/out/lrf_measurement` | `String` | `lrf/measurement` (unchanged type) |
| `fmu/out/settings` | `String` | `state/settings` (unchanged type) |
| `fmu/out/video` | `sensor_msgs/Image` | `video_frames` (in `lyrebird_videofeed`) |

Field names inside each message reuse PX4's real field names wherever DJI telemetry can actually
populate them (e.g. `remaining`/`time_remaining_s` on `BatteryStatus`, `lat`/`lon`/`alt` on
`VehicleGlobalPosition`), and simply omit PX4 fields we have no data for rather than fabricating
values. `VehicleStatus.flight_mode` stays a free-form string of DJI's own mode names -- it does not
claim compatibility with PX4's numeric `nav_state` enum, since the mode sets aren't equivalent.

## QoS

Matches PX4's own rationale: `fmu/out/*` telemetry uses the best-effort/volatile "sensor data"
profile (depth 5) since occasional missed samples are fine and low latency matters more; `fmu/in/*`
commands/setpoints and `fmu/out/vehicle_command_ack` use a reliable profile (depth 10) since those
must arrive.

## Legacy topics

`legacy_topics:=true` on either bringup launch file restores the old flat topic names for anything
whose message **type** didn't change in this redesign (video, LRF, settings, capture/media/download
results, and the three remaining string-payload command topics) via a plain ROS2 topic remap, at no
extra runtime cost. It does **not** restore the ~20 topics that consolidated into
`vehicle_command`, `trajectory_setpoint`, `manual_control_setpoint`, or any of the bundled
telemetry messages above -- a remap can only rename a topic, it can't split one new struct message
back out into several old differently-typed scalar topics. Consumers of those old topics need to
migrate to the new ones; see `lyrebird_controller/topics.py` for the exact remap list.

## Usage

**Docker (single-drone, auto-discovery):**

```bash
cd GroundStation
docker build -t lyrebird-ros .
docker run --rm --network=host lyrebird-ros
```

The image is based on `ros:humble` with CycloneDDS, `cv-bridge`, `vision-opencv`, `image-transport`, plus all Python dependencies.

**Manual multi-drone launch:**

```bash
cd GroundStation/ROS
colcon build --symlink-install && source install/setup.bash
ros2 launch lyrebird_bringup fleet_auto_discovery.launch.py
# or, to also expose the pure-rename legacy topics:
ros2 launch lyrebird_bringup fleet_auto_discovery.launch.py legacy_topics:=true
# or, to use a fleet_settings.yaml other than lyrebird_controller's bundled default:
ros2 launch lyrebird_bringup fleet_auto_discovery.launch.py fleet_settings_file:=/path/to/fleet_settings.yaml

# Example commands (namespace is the drone's own name, e.g. "mini1")
ros2 topic pub /mini1/fmu/in/vehicle_command lyrebird_msgs/msg/VehicleCommand \
  "{command: 22}"   # MAV_CMD_NAV_TAKEOFF
ros2 topic pub /mini1/fmu/in/trajectory_setpoint lyrebird_msgs/msg/TrajectorySetpoint \
  "{latitude: 49.306254, longitude: 4.593728, altitude: 20.0, yaw: 90.0, speed: 5.0, yaw_mode: 0}"
```
