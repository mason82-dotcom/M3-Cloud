"""
Lyrebird - Pilot/Safety authority single-computer test.

Runs BOTH a Pilot client (no token) and a Safety client (token "98") from one machine
against the same Android app, and checks the full takeover / release state machine.

The two clients are distinguished only by the X-Safety-Token header, not by IP, so they
can live in the same process on the same computer.

Uses /send/setRTHAltitude: a gated /send/ command that does NOT move the drone, so this
is safe to run on the bench (drone can even be on the ground / disarmed).

Usage:
    python3 test_authority.py <DRONE_IP>
