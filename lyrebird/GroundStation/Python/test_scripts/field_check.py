"""Walk the MAVLink implementation against a live aircraft, in the field.

Every defect this interface has had so far decoded cleanly and meant the wrong thing: a status
message read twelve bytes out of alignment, a gimbal quaternion transposed with its failure
flags, a checksum helper that made every genuine frame look corrupt. None of them were visible
by reading code, and none would have failed a unit test written by the same hand that wrote the
bug. They were only visible against a real aircraft, which is what this script is for.

The checks are grouped by what they can move, and the script will not cross a group boundary
without being told to:

    link     nothing is sent; the aircraft is only listened to        (default)
    ground   commands that cannot move the aircraft or the gimbal
    payload  the gimbal moves, the camera fires                       --move
    flight   the aircraft leaves the ground                           --fly, and a typed confirm

Usage:
    python field_check.py PHONE_IP                    # listen only, safe with props on
    python field_check.py PHONE_IP --phase ground
    python field_check.py PHONE_IP --phase payload --move
    python field_check.py PHONE_IP --phase flight --fly

Signing comes from --key or ``LB_MAVLINK_SIGNING_KEY``. With a key every frame is signed and the
aircraft reads this script as the Safety Computer rather than the Pilot, which is a different
authority and a different set of answers -- see signing_exercise.py, which tests that gate on its
own and is not repeated here.
