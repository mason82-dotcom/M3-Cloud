"""Which wire the ground station talks to Lyrebird over.

Lyrebird has spoken HTTP since the beginning: commands are POSTs to port 8080, telemetry is a
JSON stream on 8081. The MAVLink endpoint is newer and covers a growing subset of the same ground.
Rather than fork the client, this module lets the existing :class:`DJIInterface` swap the wire
underneath itself, because the whole surface funnels through exactly two chokepoints — the
telemetry dictionary and ``requestSend`` — and everything above them (every getter, every ROS
publisher, every script) reads that dictionary and calls those methods without caring how they
were filled.

Select the wire with the ``LB_TRANSPORT`` environment variable:

``both``
    The default. Telemetry from MAVLink, commands over MAVLink where it has an equivalent and
    HTTP where it does not (media download, and anything else MAVLink has no form for yet). MAVLink
    is the lighter wire, so it is preferred wherever it can carry the whole request; HTTP fills the
    gaps rather than being the primary path.
``mavlink``
    Telemetry from the MAVLink stream, commands and settings through MAVLink wherever the
    aircraft exposes an equivalent. A setting with no MAVLink representation uses its explicit
    phone-HTTP configuration endpoint; flight commands never fall back to HTTP.
``http``
    Nothing touches MAVLink. Kept for ground stations built against this project's predecessor,
    WildBridge, and for links where only HTTP is reachable.
