"""Central registry of Lyrebird's ROS 2 topic names, types, and QoS profiles.

Single source of truth for the PX4-DDS-style `/fmu/in/...` (ground -> drone) and
`/fmu/out/...` (drone -> ground) topics, so `controller.py` and `ros_monitor.py`
(a separate container image, see GroundStation/video_test/ros_monitor/Dockerfile)
no longer hand-duplicate the same topic list -- they both import this module.

LEGACY_TOPIC_MAP also drives the `legacy_topics` launch argument in
lyrebird_bringup: when enabled, each node remaps every new name below to its
old flat name so pre-migration consumers keep working unchanged.

A plain ROS2 `remappings=` entry only renames a topic -- it cannot change what
message type flows through it. That's enough for every topic whose *type*
didn't change (video, lrf_*, settings, capture/media/download results,
goto_trajectory_dji_native, set_setting, download_media), so those are listed
in LEGACY_TOPIC_MAP for the bringup launch files to remap directly. It is
*not* enough for the topics that consolidate several old differently-typed
scalar topics into one new struct message (vehicle_command,
trajectory_setpoint, manual_control_setpoint, and every bundled telemetry
topic below) -- renaming "battery_status" to "battery_level" would still put a
BatteryStatus message on a topic old subscribers expect to carry a Float64.
For those, controller.py's own `legacy_topics` node parameter drives a small
compatibility shim that publishes/subscribes the exact old topics and types
alongside the new ones, sourced from the same underlying data.
