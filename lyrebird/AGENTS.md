# AGENTS.md — Lyrebird

Lyrebird is an open-source Android ground-station app (Kotlin + DJI Mobile SDK V5) that runs on the RC's Android system — built into controllers like the RC Pro/RC Plus, or on a phone connected to a non-smart controller like the RC-N3 — turning it into a networked drone server, speaking MAVLink 2 and HTTP side by side — both on by default — plus TCP telemetry, WHIP/WHEP video publishing, and auto-discovery. HTTP is kept alongside MAVLink for compatibility with ground stations built against this project's predecessor, WildBridge, and as the API for what MAVLink doesn't cover (media download, AI detections, live settings). It is paired with a Python GroundStation library, ROS 2 Humble packages, and a Docker MediaMTX/video-test stack. This file tells coding agents how the repo is laid out and how to work in it safely.

## Project Overview

- **Android app** (Kotlin, DJI MSDK V5.18): `LyrebirdApp/android-sdk-v5-as/` — the `:app` module is the app; `:uxsdk` is stock DJI UXSDK with a few intentional modifications.
- **Python GroundStation**: `GroundStation/Python/lyrebird_groundstation/` — `dji_client.py` (`DJIInterface`), `dji_helpers.py`, `mavlink_helpers.py`; `lyrebird_dji_helpers.py` is a compatibility shim.
- **ROS 2 Humble**: `GroundStation/ROS/` — `lyrebird_controller`, `lyrebird_videofeed`, `lyrebird_bringup` (launch files).
- **Video test stack**: `GroundStation/video_test/compose.yaml` — MediaMTX + a browser dashboard in `GroundStation/video_test/webapp/`.
- **Safety model**: two-computer authority. A Safety Computer can seize command authority via the `X-Safety-Token` header; takeover is persistent and only the Safety Computer returns control. Safety-adjacent logic lives in `GroundStation/Python/djiInterfaceSafety.py`, `GroundStation/Python/lyrebird_groundstation/safety.py`, and on-device.
- **Key ports on each drone**: MAVLink 2 `14550` (UDP), HTTP commands `8080`, TCP telemetry `8081`, UDP discovery `30000` (+ mDNS, subnet scan), WHIP/WHEP video via MediaMTX.
- **Supported public video path**: WHIP publish → MediaMTX → WHEP playback. The older direct RC-hosted WebSocket-signaling video viewer/server path has been removed from the public app and tooling; do not reintroduce it.

## Coding Agent Workflow

1. Preserve unrelated worktree changes. Read `git status` and the relevant diff before editing a modified file; never reset or overwrite user work.
2. Run checks from the repository root for Python (see Quality Gates), and from `LyrebirdApp/android-sdk-v5-as/` for Gradle work. The persistent terminal keeps its working directory — be explicit about which root a command belongs to.
3. Start from the failing behavior, owning abstraction, nearby test, or exact log entry. Avoid broad refactors until a focused check proves the controlling path.
4. GroundStation Python: keep pure helpers extracted before touching ROS/MAVLink/socket-bound behavior. When changing anything on the MAVLink wire, check it against the HTTP surface with the dashboard's MAVLink tab — every defect in that work so far has been a frame that decoded cleanly and meant the wrong thing, which no compiler or linter sees. Do not hide missing dependencies behind conditional imports or `try/except` import fallbacks (except documented cross-container cases).
5. Make the smallest coherent change, run the narrowest relevant test immediately, then widen validation in proportion to risk.
6. Keep code, comments, and documentation in English.

### Generated and Runtime Files

- Never edit `build/`, `**/outputs/`, `dist/`, caches, `*.apk`, `*.ndjson`, `GroundStation/video_test/logs/`, or other generated/runtime artifacts by hand.
- `local.properties` (Android SDK path + DJI API key) is per-machine and never committed.
- Do not commit deployment secrets, `google-services.json`, keystores, recordings, or runtime state.

## Quick Start

### Python GroundStation

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e GroundStation/Python                # shared client; pulls in requests
pip install -r GroundStation/ROS/requirements.txt   # only if working on ROS bits
pip install pymavlink                               # only for mavlink_listen.py
pytest GroundStation/tests -q
python3 -m compileall -q GroundStation/Python GroundStation/ROS
```

### Android

```bash
cd LyrebirdApp/android-sdk-v5-as
cp local.properties.example local.properties   # set sdk.dir and AIRCRAFT_API_KEY
./gradlew :app:compileDebugKotlin            # fast validation of Kotlin changes
./gradlew :app:assembleCurrentDebug          # current variant
./gradlew :app:assembleDemoBiomassDebug      # demo/biomass variant
./auto_install_on_connect.sh current --build    # build+install to a connected device
```

### Video test stack

```bash
docker compose -f GroundStation/video_test/compose.yaml up -d --build
# dashboard: http://localhost:8090   MediaMTX WHIP/WHEP: http://localhost:8889
# RTSP: rtsp://localhost:8554  MediaMTX API: http://localhost:9997  ICE UDP: :8189
docker compose -f GroundStation/video_test/compose.yaml down
```

Runtime diagnostics land in `GroundStation/video_test/logs/` (git-ignored).

### Documentation site

```bash
npm install
npm run dev      # local preview at http://localhost:4321/lyrebird/
npm run build    # production build into dist/ (validate doc edits with this)
```

- Starlight (Astro) site at the repo root. Content lives in `src/content/docs/` (`.md`/`.mdx`); the sidebar is configured in `astro.config.mjs`; `src/content.config.ts` wires the Starlight content collection.
- Images are **not duplicated**: pages reference the shared copies under `docs/images/`.
- `.github/workflows/docs.yml` builds and deploys to GitHub Pages on pushes to `main` (repo setting: Pages → Source = GitHub Actions). The deployed URL follows the fork that runs it, e.g. `https://<owner>.github.io/lyrebird/` — `astro.config.mjs` sets `site`/`base` for `SDU-UAS-Center.github.io`; adjust when deploying from another fork.
- New pages must be added to the `sidebar` in `astro.config.mjs`; keep page slugs kebab-case.

## Project Structure

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `LyrebirdApp/android-sdk-v5-as/` | Android build root (`:app`, `:uxsdk`); Lyrebird-owned code lives under `webrtc/`, `edge/`, `controller/`, `mavlink/`, `server/`, `telemetry/`, and related packages |
| `LyrebirdApp/lyrebird-app/` | App source (`com.lyrebird.rc`), navigation graph, FlightDeckActivity |
| `GroundStation/Python/lyrebird_groundstation/` | Shared Python helper package (dji_client, dji_helpers, mavlink_helpers, transport) |
| `GroundStation/mavlink/lyrebird.xml` | The Lyrebird MAVLink dialect. Source of truth for `LYREBIRD_STATUS`. Regenerate with mavgen and update `transport.py` (struct, size, CRC_EXTRA) together with the Android side (`MavlinkMessages.kt` wire layout, `MavlinkCrc.kt` CRC_EXTRA). mavgen sorts fields by type size on the wire for MAVLink 1/2 — XML declaration order is not the wire order |
| `GroundStation/Python/djiInterfaceSafety.py` | Safety-authority handling for the two-computer model |
| `GroundStation/ROS/lyrebird_controller/` | ROS package wrapping DJI control |
| `GroundStation/ROS/lyrebird_videofeed/` | ROS package for video feed |
| `GroundStation/ROS/lyrebird_bringup/` | Launch/config for the ROS stack |
| `GroundStation/ROS/lyrebird_msgs/` | ROS message definitions shared by the ROS packages |
| `GroundStation/tests/` | Pytest suite for the Python ground-station and video-test components |
| `GroundStation/video_test/` | MediaMTX config + webapp for the video dashboard |
| `GroundStation/qgc/` | QGroundControl MAVLink Actions config — Takeoff/Land/RTL Fly View buttons (`lyrebird-actions.json`) |
| `scripts/check_radon_complexity.py` | Complexity gate used by pre-commit/CI |
| `GroundStation/video_test/compose.yaml` | MediaMTX + dashboard compose file |
| `src/content/docs/` | Starlight documentation content |
| `astro.config.mjs` | Starlight site config: sidebar, edit links, base path |
| `.github/workflows/ci.yml` | GroundStation Python gates plus Lyrebird-owned Android Spotless/compile/unit tests on PRs and `main` |
| `.github/workflows/docs.yml` | Builds the Starlight site and deploys it to GitHub Pages on `main` |

## Configuration Notes

- `pyproject.toml` is the source of truth for Ruff (line length 100, Python 3.10 target), pytest paths (`GroundStation/Python` + `GroundStation/video_test/webapp`), mypy scope, and bandit scope.
- Android SDK/API key live in `local.properties` (never committed).
- MediaMTX behavior is defined in `GroundStation/video_test/mediamtx.yml`.

## Testing & Quality Gates

Local pre-commit hooks and `.github/workflows/ci.yml` run the same checks.
Treat a failing local hook as part of finishing the change — CI will fail the same way on
pull requests and pushes to `main`.

```bash
pre-commit install
pre-commit run --all-files
```

Hooks configured in `.pre-commit-config.yaml` (mirrored by CI jobs of the same name):

- **Ruff lint + format** — scoped to `GroundStation/**.py` (`ruff check --fix` locally, `ruff check` / `ruff format --check` in CI)
- **Radon complexity** — `python scripts/check_radon_complexity.py`, B-or-better blocks (blocks with cyclomatic complexity ≥ 11 fail)
- **Mypy** — gradual typing over `GroundStation/Python/lyrebird_groundstation` + `lyrebird_dji_helpers.py`
- **Bandit** — `bandit -r GroundStation -ll --skip B101`
- **GroundStation tests** — `python -m pytest GroundStation/tests -q` (manual stage locally; always run in CI)
- **Android Spotless** — `./gradlew :app:spotlessKotlinCheck` on Lyrebird-owned Kotlin (`LyrebirdApp/lyrebird-app/**/*.kt`)
- **Android compile + unit tests** — `./gradlew :app:compileCurrentDebugKotlin :app:testCurrentDebugUnitTest` (manual stage locally; always run in CI, with `qualityLyrebird` Detekt/Lint reports)

Run the manual test hooks with:

```bash
pre-commit run groundstation-tests android-tests --hook-stage manual
```

Vendor DJI/UXSDK quality stays out of the required gate (`qualityDji`); do not fail CI on inherited sample code.

## Code Conventions

- All code, comments, and docs in English; Python type hints expected.
- Imports at module scope, no conditional-import flags; add new packages to the relevant `requirements.txt`.
- Follow existing patterns when adding GroundStation helpers, ROS nodes, or app pages; register new Android pages in `data/AircraftFragmentPageInfoFactory.kt` and the nav graph.
- Keep generated/runtime artifacts out of Git.
- Safety-critical changes (authority takeover, virtual-stick, control loops, RTH) deserve extra tests and explicit review; never weaken the takeover semantics.

## Commit Attribution

- Do **not** add `Co-Authored-By: Claude ...` (or any other `Co-Authored-By:` line for AI) to commit messages.
- If acknowledging AI assistance, append a short plain-text comment at the very end of the commit message, e.g. `AI-assisted by Claude Opus 5.` (use the actual model name, e.g. `Claude Opus 5`, `Claude Sonnet 5`).
- Other human `Co-Authored-By:` trailers are fine and must be kept.
