/**
 * Lyrebird's own flight modes, reported in `HEARTBEAT.custom_mode`.
 *
 * The heartbeat claims `MAV_AUTOPILOT_PX4` — not because Lyrebird runs PX4, but because
 * QGroundControl only enables its Fly View action buttons (Takeoff / Land / RTL) for firmware
 * plugins that declare guided-mode capabilities, and its Generic plugin (selected for
 * `MAV_AUTOPILOT_INVALID` / `_GENERIC`) declares none. The cost of that claim is that QGC
 * renders `custom_mode` through PX4's mode enum, so the values here are PX4's packed mode
 * numbers (`(main_mode << 16) | (sub_mode << 24)`) and each Lyrebird mode is mapped to the
 * PX4 mode whose meaning matches — which PX4's list does remarkably well, down to Takeoff, Land
 * and Return existing as named modes (ArduCopter's list has no such modes, which is why PX4 is
 * the right claim rather than a smaller lie).
 *
 * The reverse direction matters too: QGC's PX4 plugin asks for Land / RTL by sending `SET_MODE`
 * with these numbers, and [fromPx4Mode] turns a request back into the mode it named, which the
 * endpoint then acts on through the motion sink.
 *
 * The names line up with `MAV_STANDARD_MODE` where a portable equivalent exists, so the
 * standard-modes protocol (`AVAILABLE_MODES` / `CURRENT_MODE` / `MAV_CMD_DO_SET_STANDARD_MODE`)
 * can advertise them by their portable identity as well. [MANUAL] and [INTELLIGENT] have no
 * standard equivalent and stay custom-only rather than being forced into a nearby mode that
 * would misdescribe what the aircraft is doing.
 *
 * @param guided the aircraft is being flown by something other than the pilot's sticks
 * @param manualInput the pilot on the sticks has authority
